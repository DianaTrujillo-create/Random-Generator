I created a random password generator based on the users selected criteria. The user will be prompted to choose between the qualifying criteria being: 

Length of password between 8 to 128 characters

Character types (uppercase, lowercase, symbols, or numbers)

Once deploying the application you should be able to get a random password generated based on the options chosen. If any of the options from the criteria hasn't been chosen; it will prompt to retry the password generator again.
